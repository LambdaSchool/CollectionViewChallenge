// Collection views are a flexible way to present content on the applcation to the user. It's gets information from data source objects and uses a combination of cells, layout, and supplementary views.
//It depends on the requirements, but mostly we'll want to use table views when we're displaying simple lists and collection views are used when we want to be able to customize our app more.
// The collection view methods are responsible for returning the number of items along with all of the items.
// The Table view uses a delegate adopted from the protocol to provide the information, supplies the number of sections and number of rows. Also with the table view we have numberOfRowsInSection and with the collection view we have the numberOfItemsInSection (same differences for the cell as well.)
// Collection views can be display images horizontally as you scroll.TVC's are probably more preferable when we're just creating a simple list.
