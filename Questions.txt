A collection view controller is controls a particular collection view.

A TVC controls table views and CVC controls collection views.

One uses UITableViewDelagate and UITableViewDataSource and the other uses UICollectionViewDelagateFlowLayout.


If you want items is a table which is neatly in rows, use a TVC. If you want items to be free flowing and not in rows, use CVC.

You use sections when you have multiple things to display in the row neatly.
