1. A collection view controller is like a table view controller, but instead of displaying objects in linear rows it displays objects in a variety of different ways.

2. You use a TVC when you want to display objects in a set, linear fashion in portrait view. If you want an app to display items in a way pleasing to the user and you want to display them in landscape view or in any non-linear view, then it would be better to use CVC.

3.There are no differences in the data source methods.

4. One interface that you would not be able to build with TVCs would be an interface used in the LDS Gospel Library app. When you click on a Standard Work in the app it takes you to a view that lists all of the chapters starting side-by-side and then starting a new row when space in the view runs out. I think that a TVC would be preferably when you need to present the user with information in a linear, logical order, if that is the only purpose of the app.

5. You use sections when you want cells that present different types of data. Instead of cloning cells over and over again in a section, you create a new cell that appears in a new section. The section allows you to provide a logical separation of content.
